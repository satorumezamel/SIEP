🧠 Reproducible EEG–Quantum Nonlocal Correlation Experiments

These are the world’s first procedures and Python codes demonstrating reproducible nonlocal correlations between human consciousness (EEG signals) and cloud-based quantum computation outcomes.
This protocol transcends the traditional separation of subjectivity and objectivity in science and even suggests the existence of a third subjectivity that observes the experiment itself.

By following the detailed step-by-step guide, anyone can set up the environment at home and reproduce the results in under one hour.

⚙️ Required Environment
	•	EEG device: Muse S or Muse 2
	•	EEG recording app: Mind Monitor (iOS / Android) with Dropbox for data storage
	•	Quantum computing environment: Amazon Braket (AWS, region specified in the guide, e.g., us-east-1)
	•	Local analysis environment: Python (Anaconda) + Jupyter Notebook
	•	Shared codes in this repository: Python scripts and notebooks for quantum execution and correlation analysis

🌐 Conceptual Overview
	•	Two parallel but unconnected streams: EEG recording and quantum execution run simultaneously, but the quantum computer has no access to EEG data or timing.
	•	Post-hoc analysis only: Correlations are computed after both datasets are collected (no real-time feedback).
	•	Unexpected reproducibility: Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05, after correction) repeatedly appear between quantum states (00, 01, 10, 11) and EEG frequency-band features (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma; mean, peak, stability).
	•	Interpretation: Such correlations are impossible under current physical theory, yet are reproducibly observed—supporting the Subjectivity Intersection Hypothesis, which posits that consciousness itself is quantum-coherent and that a third observing subjectivity exists.
