# 🧠 Reproducible EEG–Quantum Nonlocal Correlation Experiments

These are the world’s first procedures and Python codes demonstrating **reproducible nonlocal correlations** between human consciousness (EEG signals) and cloud-based quantum computation outcomes.  
This protocol transcends the traditional separation of subjectivity and objectivity in science and even suggests the existence of a **third subjectivity** that observes the experiment itself.

**By following the detailed step-by-step guide, anyone can set up the environment at home and reproduce the results in under one hour.**

## ⚙️ Required Environment

- EEG device: Muse S or Muse 2  
- EEG recording app: Mind Monitor (iOS / Android) with Dropbox for data storage  
- Quantum computing environment: Amazon Braket (AWS, region specified in the guide, e.g., us-east-1)  
- Local analysis environment: Python (Anaconda) + Jupyter Notebook  
- Shared codes in this repository: Python scripts and notebooks for quantum execution and correlation analysis

## 🌐 Conceptual Overview

- Two parallel but unconnected streams: EEG recording and quantum execution run simultaneously, but the quantum computer has no access to EEG data or timing.  
- Post-hoc analysis only: Correlations are computed after both datasets are collected (no real-time feedback).  
- Unexpected reproducibility: Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05, after correction) repeatedly appear between quantum states (00, 01, 10, 11) and EEG frequency-band features (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma; mean, peak, stability).  
- Interpretation: Such correlations are impossible under current physical theory, yet are reproducibly observed — supporting the **Subjectivity Intersection Hypothesis**, which posits that consciousness itself is quantum-coherent and that a third observing subjectivity exists.
