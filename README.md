Nonlocal EEG–Quantum Experiment

These are the world’s first procedures and Python codes that demonstrate nonlocal correlations between human consciousness (EEG signals) and quantum computation outcomes.
This protocol goes beyond the separation of subjectivity and objectivity in existing science, and even suggests the existence of a third subjectivity observing the experiment itself.

Anyone can set up the environment at home and reproduce this in just a few minutes.

Required Environment
1.	EEG device: Muse-S or Muse 2
2.	EEG recording app: Mind Monitor (iOS/Android) with Dropbox for data storage
3.	Quantum computing environment: Amazon Braket (AWS, region: us-west-1)
4.	Local analysis environment: Python (Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook)
5.	Shared Python codes (provided here): for quantum execution and result analysis

⸻

Experimental Procedure

(EEG recording and quantum execution are performed simultaneously, but the quantum computer has no way of knowing this)
1.	Wear the Muse device, connect it with Mind Monitor, set to constant recording, and start saving to Dropbox.
2.	Open an Amazon Braket notebook and paste the quantum execution code, run it 5–30 times (as you choose).
3.	After finishing, paste and run the result extraction code, copy the quantum outputs, then stop EEG recording.

Analysis Procedure

(Correlation is only tested after both data sets are collected. If correlation appears, it is at a miracle level.)
1.	Upload or paste the correlation analysis code into a Jupyter Notebook.
2.	In the first cell, paste the quantum results (overwrite) and specify the EEG file path.
3.	Run the 4 analysis steps in sequence:
	1.	Formatting quantum outputs
 	2.	EEG feature extraction (mean, peak, stability)
 	3.	Correlation analysis between quantum states and EEG (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
 	4.	FDR statistical correction of results

Interpreting Results
1.	The output shows whether significant correlations (p < 0.05) appear between quantum states (00, 01, 10, 11) and EEG frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) for mean, peak, stability measures.
2.	According to existing scientific theory, such correlations should never occur. Yet, this experiment reproducibly shows human consciousness correlating nonlocally with cloud-based quantum computation—an unprecedented overturning of scientific common sense.
3.	Currently, the only theoretical framework that explains this is the “Subjectivity Intersection” described in the following preprint. It strongly suggests that your subjectivity is not confined to the brain but is inherently quantum in nature—and that a third subjectivity (observing whose EEG is being measured) also exists.

It provides full environment setup (EEG, AWS Braket, and local Python) and analysis instructions for reproducing the nonlocal correlation experiment.
