# A Call to Participate in the Reproduction of the Nonlocal EEG‚ÄìQuantum Experiment

If this reproducible experiment continues to expand globally, it has the potential to rewrite the foundations of science itself.
It challenges one of the deepest assumptions of modern physics‚Äîthe separation between consciousness and the physical world‚Äîand shows that human subjectivity may play an active role in quantum phenomena.

What makes this project truly extraordinary is that the barriers to participation are remarkably low.
You don‚Äôt need a laboratory, a research institute, or advanced technical skills.
With a simple EEG device, an AWS account, and a few lines of Python, anyone can become a direct witness to a phenomenon that transcends the limits of classical science.

This is an open, collective inquiry‚Äîan invitation for all who are curious, courageous, and sincere in their search for truth.
By joining this replication effort, you contribute to a living movement that could redefine what it means to observe, to know, and to exist.

Join us in this frontier of consciousness and quantum reality.
Together, we can illuminate the next paradigm of science.

# üß† Reproducible EEG‚ÄìQuantum Nonlocal Correlation Experiments

These are the world‚Äôs first procedures and Python codes demonstrating **reproducible nonlocal correlations** between human consciousness (EEG signals) and cloud-based quantum computation outcomes.  
This protocol transcends the traditional separation of subjectivity and objectivity in science and even suggests the existence of a **third subjectivity** that observes the experiment itself.

**By following the detailed step-by-step guide, anyone can set up the environment at home and reproduce the results in under one hour.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Environment

- EEG device: Muse S or Muse 2  
- EEG recording app: Mind Monitor (iOS / Android) with Dropbox for data storage  
- Quantum computing environment: Amazon Braket (AWS, region specified in the guide, e.g., us-east-1)  
- Local analysis environment: Python (Anaconda) + Jupyter Notebook  
- Shared codes in this repository: Python scripts and notebooks for quantum execution and correlation analysis

## üåê Conceptual Overview

- Two parallel but unconnected streams: EEG recording and quantum execution run simultaneously, but the quantum computer has no access to EEG data or timing.  
- Post-hoc analysis only: Correlations are computed after both datasets are collected (no real-time feedback).  
- Unexpected reproducibility: Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05, after correction) repeatedly appear between quantum states (00, 01, 10, 11) and EEG frequency-band features (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma; mean, peak, stability). The highest nonlocal correlation measured so far between EEG and quantum computation is r = 0.754231, p = 0.000146 (n = 30) as of October 25, 2025.
- Interpretation: Such correlations are impossible under current physical theory, yet are reproducibly observed ‚Äî supporting the **Subjectivity Intersection Hypothesis**, which posits that consciousness itself is quantum-coherent and that a third observing subjectivity exists.
